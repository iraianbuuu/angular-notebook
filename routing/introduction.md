## Introduction

Routing helps you change what the user sees in a single-page app. Angular Routing `@angular/core` if the official library for managing navigation in Angular Applications.

1. **Routes** define which component displays when a user visits a specific URL.
2. **Outlets** are placeholders in your templates that dynamically load and render components based on the active route.
3. **Links** provide a way for users to navigate between different routes in your application without triggering a full page reload.
